# Tixier-Mita laboratory integration

## Contents

The folder contains a backup of Alex DUFOUR's software that was modified and 
adapted for this live tracking software.

The other Python file is the custom program to launch on a RaspberryPI that was
configured by Alex DUFOUR with an integrated camera.

## Installation instructions

You will need to download the contents of the folder named `comm_protocol` above
and the `custom_raspberrypi_headless.py` file as well.

Transfer both of these to the RaspberryPI and put them in the same folder.  
The final folder structure should look like this :

	|
	*-- comm_protocol
	*-- custom_raspberrypi_headless.py
